* LyXiT
Edit \LaTeX fragment in LyX
* Motivation
Using with Vim/Emacs/Evil bang or shell command. It deserved a
dedicated binding if you're working with LaTeX directly or in org-mode
with a lot of formulae etc.

I'm trying my best to keep it working in both OS X/BSD and *nix world.
* Prerequisite
Make sure you have ~lyx~ and ~tex2lyx~ with the PATH environment variable.
* Example
** Emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'use-package)
(evil-define-operator link/lyxit-line (beg end type)
  "Edit current region in lyx."
  :motion evil-line
  (interactive "<R>")
  (shell-command-on-region beg end "lyxit -n -" t t)
  (when org-indent-mode
    (org-indent-mode 1)))
(bind-key "s-m" 'link/lyxit-line org-mode-map)
#+END_SRC
** Vim/Evil
#+BEGIN_SRC vim
:'<,'>!lyxit
#+END_SRC
